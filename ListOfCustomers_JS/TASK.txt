Using Bootstrap 3 or MDL and jQuery create a single page web application that allows a user to Create, List, Update and Delete customers. A customer is made of up the following attributes:
• Name;
• Email;
• Telephone;
• Address;
◦ Street;
◦ City;
◦ State;
◦ Zip.
The web application should use MVVM or MVW patterns, splitting logic into separate files (e.g.: app.js, create.js, list.js, etc.) and JSON files as the storage mechanism for each customer record.
Also, the application must demonstrate your knowledge of HTML layout and responsive design.

Once you have completed the project, email me and we will set up some time to review.  Please also email me the final project.
